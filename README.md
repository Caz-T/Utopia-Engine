# Utopia-Engine

This is an implementation of the famous Print-n'-play board game: Utopia Engine. More rules and usages are to be added here. 
**Currently the application is playable, though with potential bugs.**

This project is to be submitted as the course work of me for OOP 2022 Spring, Tsinghua University.

> For Hannah. For your future. For your inner Utopia.

## Usage
### M1 Mac users:
Just download Utopia-Engine.dmg and play. The .dmg package is always up-to-date (or close to up-to-date).
### Intel Mac users:
I'm not sure whether the package works fine on Intel Macs, but you can have a try. If it doesn't, you need a Qt 6.3.0 package with macdeployqt. 
Clone the source code repo, and follow the steps on https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/macos-deployment.html. It would be deployed for your computer.
### Windows users:
**I'm not sure whether this works fine, as I haven't tried these steps yet.**
Although the whole development process is solely done on my Mac, I'm quite sure the codes are compatible with Windows computers under the right configurations. I'll try to release a nice version for Windows once all debugging are done. 
You need a Qt 6.3.0 package with windeployqt. Clone the source code repo, and follow the steps on https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/windows-deployment.html. 


## Miscellaneous
1. I hate the class name QDialog. It lured me into naming my classes xxx_dialog rather than xxx_dialog**ue**. BrE is the cancer of modern English.
