# Utopia-Engine

This is an implementation of the famous Print-n'-play board game: Utopia Engine. More rules and usages are to be added here. 

**Currently the application is playable, though with potential bugs.**

This project is to be submitted as the course work of me for OOP 2022 Spring, Tsinghua University.

> For Hannah. For your future. For your inner Utopia.

## Installation and deployment

### M1 Mac users:

Just download Utopia-Engine.dmg and play. The .dmg package is always up-to-date (or close to up-to-date).

### Intel Mac users:

I'm not sure whether the package works fine on Intel Macs, but you can have a try. If it doesn't, you need a Qt 6.3.0 package with macdeployqt. 
Clone the source code repo, and follow the steps on https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/macos-deployment.html. It would be deployed for your computer.

### Windows users:

**I'm not sure whether this works fine, as I haven't tried these steps yet.**

Although the whole development process is solely done on my Mac, I'm quite sure the codes are compatible with Windows computers under the right configurations. I'll try to release a nice version for Windows once all debugging are done. 

You need a Qt 6.3.0 package with windeployqt. Clone the source code repo, and follow the steps on https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/windows-deployment.html. 


## Credits

Thanks to the print-and-play version of Utopia Engine itself, without which I'd spend dozens of afternoons dozing off in class. 

Thanks to Nick Hayes for the elegant game design and delicate artwork throughout the game. 

Thanks to usa175@BoardGameGeek for uploading the Chinese rulebook. Thanks to 欧冶喵、地狱的傀儡师@知乎 for drafting and revising the rulebook. Their Chinese translation of proper nouns in the game shedded light on my implementation.

Thanks to all contributors to the game design of Utopia Engine, and all players that kept the community vital.


## Miscellaneous

1. I hate the class name QDialog. It lured me into naming my classes xxx_dialog rather than xxx_dialog**ue**. BrE is the cancer of modern English.
2. It's been some painful weeks physically and mentally, which provides good excuse for not making my implementation half as elegent as the original game.
3. DO NOT LEAVE A COURSE PROJECT TO ITS DEADLINE. OR YOU'LL DIE STRUGGLING.
