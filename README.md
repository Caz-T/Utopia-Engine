# Utopia-Engine

This is an implementation of the famous Print-n'-play board game: Utopia Engine. More rules and usages are to be added here.

This project is to be submitted as the course work of me for OOP 2022 Spring, Tsinghua University.

> For Hannah. For your future. For your inner Utopia.

## Miscellaneous
1. I hate the class name QDialog. It lured me into naming my classes xxx_dialog rather than xxx_dialog**ue**. BrE is the cancer of modern English.
